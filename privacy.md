# Privacy Policy for 1001 Albums Tracker (LaMetric App)

_Last updated: June 21, 2025_

This LaMetric app, **1001 Albums Tracker**, is a simple notification tool that displays daily album information from the 1001 Albums Generator project.

## Information Collected

This app **does not collect**, store, or transmit any personal data.  
Users only provide a public **slug** from [1001albumsgenerator.com](https://1001albumsgenerator.com), which is used to fetch album information via their public API.

## How the App Works

- The app connects to a custom Render API endpoint.
- The only information displayed is:
  - Current album name and artist
  - Progress (e.g., “Album 58 of 1001”)
- No data is sent from the user’s LaMetric device back to the server.
- No cookies, tracking, or analytics are used.

## Third-Party Services

This app uses data from:

- [1001albumsgenerator.com](https://1001albumsgenerator.com) — for album metadata
- [LaMetric Cloud API](https://lametric.com/) — to display info on the user’s device
